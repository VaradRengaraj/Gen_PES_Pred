# Gen_PES_Pred

Generic Inter-atomic potentials prediction

**This is an ongoing project**
------------------------------

### Completed

- Energy training
- Pytorch based Neural network training
- Pytorch based Dataloader(cache enabled due to large size of training HDF5 file)
- HDF5 based dataset generation
- Cuda enabled if supported

### TODO's

- How to reach neural network's convergence for different atoms? (Generic network)
- Explore options to fix the coulomb matrix size if neural network's convergence could not be achieved.
- Force training
